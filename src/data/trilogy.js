        Ebb &amp; Flood was the first piece in the resilience trilogy. It
        explored the rhythm of flow: waves, impact, motion, response, undertow,
        and return. We drew on the German translation of the word Resilience{" "}
        <i>Elastizität</i> - Elasticity.
      </p>

      <p>
        The piece was seen as a commentary, and exploration, of the way we live
        in our time. We live the interplay between power and vulnerability, a
        dance of the weak and the strong. Every action is met by an equal and
        opposite reaction. Each event generates an even stronger backlash. Turns
        in unexpected and different directions cascade and ricochet, pulled and
        pushed by random elasticity. All around is surprise, unpredictability,
        shock.
      </p>
      <p>
        The piece purposefully saught to evoke emotions, provoke thought, and
        and immerse the audience in the creative elasticity, and inexorable Ebb
        and Flow of own lives outside of the performance space.

      <h2>St. Leonard's Church</h2>
      <p>
        Situated in East London, St Leonard’s Church (also known as{" "}
        <a href="https://www.shoreditchchurch.org.uk/">Shoreditch Church</a>) is
        dedicated to St Leonard, the patron saint of prisoners and those who are
        mentally ill. There has been a church on the site for many centuries.
      </p>
      <p>
        The site became the actors’ church. The nearby New Inn Yard hosted the
        initial performances of several of Shakespeare’s plays Many of the
        Elizabethan theatrical fraternity are buried in the medieval church
        under the crypt. This includes three Burbages:{" "}
        <strong>James Burbage</strong> who built the first English theatre; his
        son, <strong>Cuthbert</strong>who built the Globe theatre; and his other
        son, /<strong>Richard</strong>, who was the first to play Macbeth,
        Hamlet, Richard 3rd, Othello, and Romeo. So the first Romeo is buried in
        the crypt where Shakespeare placed the final scene of his tragic play.
      </p>
      <p>
        The church has always been committed to its community, particularly
        those who live on the streets that often have difficulties with alcohol
        or substance abuse. The church built Acorn House, an 18 bed alcohol
        rehabilitation centre which is run by the Spitalfields Crypt Trust.
      </p>
      <p>
        The project is inspired by the approach of the church, and its many
        chartiable connections - as well as the rich history of the East End. St
        Leonard’s, its features and architecture, its history and tradition is
        deeply rooted in the area. This protective and welcoming space serves as
        a starting point for the project and was an integral part of the
        creative process and ultimate performance.

      <h2>Foundation for Change</h2>
      <p>
        Ebb &amp; flood was created collaboratively alongside the registered
        charity
        <a href="https://www.foundationforchange.org.uk/">
          {" "}
          Foundation for Change
        </a>
        . FfC work for social change through education. The founders, Bob Bharij
        and Liz Naylor, have worked together since 2005 and set up FfC in 2014.
        They now have a small team of staff and volunteers based in St Leonard’s
        church. The aim of FfC is to provide a sophisticated response to the
        complexity of disadvantage, tackling social exclusion and enabling
        people who have experienced significant difficulties with drugs or
        alcohol to participate in society.
      </p>
      <p>
        Through their programmes, they help those they work with to consciously
        choose how they want to live, be it in relation to being a better
        parent, family member or partner, volunteering, or gaining employment
        and achieving financial independence. The majority of their courses are
        accompanied by accredited qualifications and include the option of
        volunteer placements which significantly boost the chances of achieving
        employment, thereby helping to break the often inter-generational cycles
        of substance misuse and support social participation.
      </p>
      <p>
        FfC bring a creative and much needed new approach to tackling
        disadvantage. Summer 2017 saw the first of a Big Lottery funded intake
        of their new Feminism for Change course – a female only programme that
        introduced key concepts of feminist theory through which participants
        were supported to view their lives. Autumn 2017 saw the launch of
        Clothing for Change (CfC) led by Bex Exell, a graduate of two of FfC’s
        courses. A trained tailor, Bex is selling her designs online under the
        Clothing for Change label, the income generated going towards the CfC
        project itself. This will be a six-month intensive course in tailoring
        where individuals will learn to design, sew and create tailored pieces
        of clothing. It will also include a detailed introduction to setting up
        their own tailoring business for individuals who want to work towards
        self-employment.
      </p>

      <p>
        FfC work in partnership with Spitalfields Crypt Trust, specifically the
        New Hanbury Project, delivering a 10 week introduction to psychology
        course to compliment the vocational courses they offer to those in
        recovery. Volunteers from the New Hanbury Project have re-landscaped the
        church gardens and tend to it daily, creating a wonderful haven away
        from the bustling Shoreditch High Street. The church grounds also
        include an allotment where volunteers in recovery from drug/alcohol
        dependency grow vegetables that are eaten in Acorn House.
      </p>

      Hoffnung, which broadly translates as "hope" in German, is the current
      project under development by genau dance company. The early themes
      include belonging, displacement, and how we hope to create a better self 
      and a better future. Genau dance company is currently actively researching 
      and developing movement and partnerships to construct this piece.
